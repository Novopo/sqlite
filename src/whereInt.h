** The query generator uses an array of instances of this structure to
** help it analyze the subexpressions of the WHERE clause.  Each WHERE
** clause subexpression is separated from the others by AND operators,
** usually, or sometimes subexpressions separated by OR.
**
** All WhereTerms are collected into a single WhereClause structure.  
** The following identity holds:
**
**        WhereTerm.pWC->a[WhereTerm.idx] == WhereTerm
**
** When a term is of the form:
**
**              X <op> <expr>
**
** where X is a column name and <op> is one of certain operators,
** then WhereTerm.leftCursor and WhereTerm.u.leftColumn record the
** cursor number and column number for X.  WhereTerm.eOperator records
** the <op> using a bitmask encoding defined by WO_xxx below.  The
** use of a bitmask encoding for the operator allows us to search
** quickly for terms that match any of several different operators.
**
** A WhereTerm might also be two or more subterms connected by OR:
**
**         (t1.X <op> <expr>) OR (t1.Y <op> <expr>) OR ....
**
** In this second case, wtFlag has the TERM_ORINFO bit set and eOperator==WO_OR
** and the WhereTerm.u.pOrInfo field points to auxiliary information that
** is collected about the OR clause.
**
** If a term in the WHERE clause does not match either of the two previous
** categories, then eOperator==0.  The WhereTerm.pExpr field is still set
** to the original subexpression content and wtFlags is set up appropriately
** but no other fields in the WhereTerm object are meaningful.
**
** When eOperator!=0, prereqRight and prereqAll record sets of cursor numbers,
** but they do so indirectly.  A single WhereMaskSet structure translates
** cursor number into bits and the translated bit is stored in the prereq
** fields.  The translation is used in order to maximize the number of
** bits that will fit in a Bitmask.  The VDBE cursor numbers might be
** spread out over the non-negative integers.  For example, the cursor
** numbers might be 3, 8, 9, 10, 20, 23, 41, and 45.  The WhereMaskSet
** translates these sparse cursor numbers into consecutive integers
** beginning with 0 in order to make the best possible use of the available
** bits in the Bitmask.  So, in the example above, the cursor numbers
** would be mapped into integers 0 through 7.
**
** The number of terms in a join is limited by the number of bits
** in prereqRight and prereqAll.  The default is 64 bits, hence SQLite
** is only able to process joins with 64 or fewer tables.

** The VDBE cursor numbers are small integers contained in

** contain gaps in the numbering sequence.  But we want to make maximum

**
** For example, if the WHERE clause expression used these VDBE
** cursors:  4, 5, 8, 29, 57, 73.  Then the  WhereMaskSet structure
** would map those cursor numbers into bits 0 through 5.
**
** Note that the mapping is not necessarily ordered.  In the example
** above, the mapping might go like this:  4->3, 5->1, 8->2, 29->0,
** 57->5, 73->4.  Or one of 719 other combinations might be used. It
** does not really matter.  What is important is that sparse cursor
